# energy-demand-forecasting
This project demonstrates a comprehensive workflow for forecasting energy consumption using Time Series analysis and ARIMA family models.
It integrates fundamental time series concepts—such as stationarity, trend, seasonality, and autocorrelation—with advanced forecasting techniques including ARIMA, SARIMA, and SARIMAX models.
The project is structured into key phases:

i)   Data Understanding & Preprocessing: Loading energy consumption data, visualizing patterns, decomposing time series, testing and transforming for stationarity.

ii)  Modeling & Forecasting: Manual and automated ARIMA modeling, hyperparameter tuning, model diagnostics, and evaluation using accuracy metrics.

iii) Forecasting Future Demand: Generating and visualizing forecasts, validating performance, and exporting results.

iv)  Documentation & Practice: Clear explanations, practice exercises, and extensions to other datasets.

Tools used include Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels, and pmdarima.
